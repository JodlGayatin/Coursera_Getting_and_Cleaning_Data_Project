### Files

There are 4 files attached to this repository:

1. README.md - a file which gives an overview of the content of this repository.
2. CodeBook.MD - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data
3. run_analysis.R - the script used to derive the clean data set from the input files
The details of fulfilling te requirements are explained as comments in the code from (1. Data Extraction 2. Merging of Data Sets 3. Updating the Activity Labels. 4. Selection of Variables with Mean and Std only 5. Updating the Variable names where needed and 6. Aggregating the values to get the mean of each variable by Subject ID and Activity Label)
